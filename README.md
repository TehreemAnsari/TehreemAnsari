# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Tehreem

I am experienced "techie", and my interests go well beyond just tech. I have a Masters in Tech and my work has been around fraud detection, KYCs, and AI Model training (LLMs and GANs). 

I am currently taking specialization course online on Robotics, Sensors, and Human anatomy.

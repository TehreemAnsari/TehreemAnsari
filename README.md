## 👋 About Me

I work at the intersection of **software engineering** and **machine learning**. I completed my master's with a specialization in **Data Science** in 2018. Since then, I've worked at Amazon, contributing to systems focused on **fraud detection**, **KYC**, **document verification**, and **recommendation engines**.

In April 2024, I transitioned from Amazon to pursue more **deep learning–oriented projects**. I build my projects **end-to-end**, leveraging my background in both **software development** and **data science**.

💬 Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate, share ideas, or discuss the latest in tech.
